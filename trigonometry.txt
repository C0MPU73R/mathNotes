The basics of trigonometry started with the study of triangles back in the ancient Greek days, in which more tools were added
to the field over the years.

We can first start with something called the unit circle, which is a special type of circle that has a radius of 1 and is centered at the origin
of the XY plane. The equation for it is: x^2 + y^2 = 1.
The circle has a variety of properties that can help us in the world of trigonometry.
The circle is actually created by taking our number line. 
That line is then wrapped around in a circle shape from some point back to the original point.
This is done in a counterclock wise direction. This is the positive part of the number line.
The negative part of the number line is wrapped in the clockwise direction. 

The line is essentially wrapping the circle an infinite number of times in the said direction,
which gives us an infinite number of points on the circle.

We call the initial point on the circle at (1,0), the start of the unit circle from 0 degrees or 0 radians
This exact same point is inifinitely mapped to anytime we complete one whole rotation of a circle and end up back at that point
So the first time we orbit a circle from 0 and back to that same point, the value is now 2*pi since we completed one full rotation.
This particiular value is also the cicrumference of our circle since our unit circle has a radius of 1 and C = 2*pi*r = 2*pi*1

We can also go in the negative direction from 0 and end back up at the same point, but this time the  value will be -2*pi because we traversed in the clockwise direction.
If we were to start at 0 again, and do 2 full traversals in the counter-clockwise direction and end up back at (1,0) our value would now be 4*pi, because we went around the circle twice.
This is actually also 720 degrees, which is 2 times the number of degrees in a circle.

ASIDE: This was also a really popular sniper trickshot in the videogame "Call of Duty" back in the mid-2000s. The player, a using a sniper rifle, would jump and spin around twice from some start point, then aim for its target and make the shot.
This shot was known as the 720, which was a bit more impressive than a 360.
 

We also have serveral other notable points such as a quarter of the circle, at point (0,1) at 90 degrees or pi / 2.
This value is easily found by taking the circumference of out our unit circle, 2pi and taking 1/4 of it which =2pi(1/4) = pi / 2. This is in the counter-clockwise direction. 

We also have a point to represent 3/4 of the circle at the point (0,-1), which is 3pi / 2 or 275 degrees.
